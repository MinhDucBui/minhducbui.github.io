# 1. Motivation
A high punctuality of trains leads to customer satisfaction. With the help of the project
"PlanKorridore" (see [official announcement](https://karriere.deutschebahn.com/karriere-de/jobs/berufserfahrene/ingenieure/grossprojekte/PlanKorridor-4076134) )
traffic on busy rail routes are to be made more robust, thereby also
improve the planning capabilities of the trains. A total of four particularly heavily congested corridors
have been identified throughout Germany and defined as "Plan Korridore". 
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/plankorridore.png" alt="title-img">
<em>Fig: Plankorridore are 1. Hamburg, 2. Mannheim - Frankfurt - Fulda, 3: Köln -
Dortmund, 4: Nürnberg - Würzburg</em>
</figure>

With the help of scheduling measures, trains 
running through planned corridors should remain on schedule or be made on schedule. Scheduling measures are, for 
example, a change of platform edge for a train with a door malfunction, an early turnaround of a train or even a 
rerouting of delayed trains via alternative routes.


The goal is not only to improve timeliness in the corridors, but also in the entire network. Because if there are 
delayed trains in these corridors the delay is propagated through the entire network due to various interactions. This 
leads to consequential delays in the entire network due to the large number of trains running through these corridors



# 2. Prerequisite

In the following section, we will further specify the delay prediction framework.

## 2.1 Description of the Problem

The requirement of the forecast is not to estimate a continuous value for the delay of a train, but the prediction of a 
delay of a train in a time interval (e.g. in the interval 1 - 3 minutes) - It is therefore a classification problem. 
Classes are defined as follows: [<1, 1-3, 4-6, 7-15, 16-30, 31-40, 41+].  The background for this is that for each class 
different proposals for scheduling measures were defined.

Another question we need to clarify is the time horizon of the prediction. As an example, let's take the 
Fulda - Frankfurt - Mannheim corridor. If we forecast a very high delay in Mannheim after the departure in Frankfurt,
skipping the train station at Frankfurt airport can not be performed. This is because we had to inform passengers 
about skipping this station in a reasonable time **before** the Frankfurt stop, so that they can take a replacement 
train from Frankfurt to the airport. As a rule of thumb, we say that
we want to make predictions about the delay at the final stop 1 to 2 hours before entering the corridor.


## 2.2. Challenges of the Problem

Delay predictions are still a difficult task today. It is obvious that many external factors make prediction difficult, 
even impossible - there are, however, negative factors that we can include in the models. The first step to overcome such 
hurdles is to identify the problems.


## 2.2.1. Class Imbalance
*We redact details of our dataset.*

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/imbalance.png" alt="imbalance-img">
</figure>

Severe delays occur only rarely, but these are the cases which are important for our problem. However, "naive" regression 
models will not be able to predict exactly such cases. Too low amounts of high delays cannot be learned by the model. 
Since the bulk of the data consists of low delays, the model will learn the patterns of low delays. Mathematically 
speaking, when training, the minimization of empirical risk is dominated by the high amount of low delays and thus the 
model will also predict this data better. This problem is also called "the long tail problem".

The same problems arise when we convert the problem into a classification problem.
The long tail problem gives us imbalanced classes.


## 2.2.2. Data Inaccuracies

Our data, as we discuss later in Section ???, consists largely of train running reports. While it is possible to infer 
information from train movements and possible patterns, many factors that lead to delay cannot be inferred from train 
movements. For example, because the available train running messages are macroscopic, conflicts on a track at a stop 
cannot be detected. From our train running messages, we cannot see which track a train is even entering and whether a 
track is occupied. We cannot map and predict various infrastructure conflicts and train dependencies from our data, 
although such conflicts play an important role. This would require microscopic data sets, which we do not currently have.

## 2.2.3. Localities

Dynamics that prevail on one route section can behave completely differently on another route section. Machine learning 
algorithms, however, try to draw information from all route sections and generalize it. It is obvious that the Frankfurt 
station stop behaves differently than the Gerolstein stop, which has little passenger volume. Such dynamics are essential 
in the development of models. One should also be aware that there is a trade-off between a uniform model, associated with 
lower computational load, and many small models that can represent the dynamics.


## 2.2.4. Flexibility of the Problem

The problem can be viewed from several angles: One approach would be to view the problem as a regression problem. 
One would predict the delay in seconds (or other time units) and then convert the delay to the appropriate classes.

It is also useful to follow a multiclassification approach. In multiclassification, one directly estimates the delay 
class for each observation rather than its delay in seconds.

Another approach uses the information from the relationship between classes to directly predict a class for each 
observation. The classes follow an order based on the height ̈he of the delay. Thus, for a misclassification it is 
relevant whether the error is two or three classes large. This approach is called ordinal classification or ordinal 
regression. 

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/flexibility.png" alt="flexibility-img">
</figure>

Why does flexibility now make the problem more difficult? It is not clear a priori which of these approaches is the 
best. So we have to understand, evaluate and compare 3 different approaches, and also the different models that exist 
for each approach.

# 3. Evaluation

## 3.1. Model Selection and Assessment


It is important to first of all keep in mind what exactly we want to achieve. We have exactly 2 different goals:


**Model Selection:** We want to be able to evaluate and compare the performance of different models in order to 
choose the best model in the end.

**Model Assessment:** We want to estimate the error of the final model on new data (generalization error).

The best practice is to split the available data into 3 parts: a training set, a validation set and a test set. 
The training set is used to train the model and the validation set is then used to evaluate the performance of the 
models and possibly try different hyperparameters. How to evaluate a performance or the error of models will be 
discussed in more detail. The best model, according to the selected metric, is taken in the end. This would be the 
Model Selections process.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/train_val_test.png" alt="flexibility-img">
<em>Fig: A possible split: 60% training data, 20% validation data, 20% test data.</em>
</figure>

The test set is used to estimate the generalization error of the best model. So one should leave this set untouched 
until one is done with the model selection. 


## 3.2. K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-Fold Cross-Validation is a widely used method to estimate the expected generalization error. The method can also be 
used to get around the problem that data sets are too small for the "usual" split into training, validation and test 
set. In the end we have only 2 splits, a training set and a test set.

We first divide the data set into training data and test data, setting aside the test data. We again divide the training 
data into *K* approximately equal folds. Next, for the *k*th fold, we will train the model on the other *K - 1* folds 
of the training data set and calculate the error on the *k*th fold of the training data set. Perform this procedure 
for *k = 1,2,...,K*. In the end, *K* prediction errors are obtained, and then the mean value is calculated. 
One can thereby compare different learning methods with different hyperparameters, where the goal is to minimize 
the mean value.

In the last step, the whole training data set is used to train the model with the found hyperparameters, 
which is our final model. Finally, the final model is evaluated on the set aside test data and gives us the generalization error.

<em>Fig: Example of a split for K = 5. Flowchart of CV.</em>
</figure>

## 3.3. Evaluation Metrics


The Confusion Matrix is a tool to visualize the performance of a model and to examine how it behaves in the individual
classes. It can thus show problems with class imbalance.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/cm.png" alt="flexibility-img">
<em>Fig: Illustration of a Confusion Matrix. It is easy to see that we cannot predict the class 
"not on time" ("nicht pünktlich"). It shows that our model is not suitable..</em>
</figure>

From Confusion, one can compute other metrics, especially important metrics for the analysis of individual classes.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/cm_metrics.png" alt="flexibility-img">
<em>Fig: Illustration of a Confusion Matrix. It is easy to see that we cannot predict the class 
"not on time" ("nicht pünktlich"). It shows that our model is not suitable..</em>
</figure>

**Precision:** The precision can be calculated for each class. It is calculated for class j by dividing the correct 
predictions of class j by the total number of predictions for class j. Or stated informally: 
If the model predicts class j, how "certain" is the model?

**Recall:** The recall can also be calculated for each class. It is calculated for class j by dividing the correct 
predictions for class j by the total number of actual observations in class j. Recall, then, tells us what fraction 
of class j we correctly predicted.

**F1-Score:** The F1 score of class j is calculated by the harmonic mean value
of precision and recall of class j of the model. 

**Macro F1-Score:** The macro F1 score can now be used to evaluate the overall performance 
of the model by averaging the individual F1 scores. However, if one wants to evaluate the importance of the individual 
classes differently, one can introduce weights for the individual F1 scores. One choice for the weights is to take into 
account the number of observations in the classes:

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/macro_f1.png" alt="flexibility-img">
</figure>
where n is the total number of observations and n_i is the number of observations
in class i.


## 3.4. Baseline Models

Baseline models give us a reference to compare different models. We always need a reference to know whether the 
developed model is usable or not. The goodness of a model is always relative to the difficulty of the problem. It is 
difficult to evaluate how well our model performs, especially in our problem.

**Naive Classifier:** The simplest model in a classification is guessing. In a binary classification, 
we would have an average accuracy of 50%. Extended to a multiclassification with 7 classes, we get an average hit 
accuracy of 0.143 by guessing. However, since we have class imbalance present, we can use a new approach, 
which we call the naive classifier. The naive classifier takes into account the number of observations in the classes.
Using the available data, we can estimate the class probability of class k estimated by
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/naive_1.png" alt="flexibility-img">
</figure>

where n is the number of available observations. The naive classifier now classifies all observations x to the class 
with the highest estimated class probability, i.e.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/naive_2.png" alt="flexibility-img">
</figure>

In words: We classify each observation to the class with the most observations in the training set.


**Relative Position:** The naive classifier is a general model that can be taken as a baseline for any classification. 
The classifier does not process any information that is available in the context of the problem. For example, one 
would not classify a train that is 2 hours late as on-time at the next operating point just because there are more 
on-time trains than unpunctual trains. It is clear that the delay in the starting point plays a significant role 
in the delay in the ending point. We will use this information in the next "relative position" model. The relative 
position predicts for each observation the delay it has at the starting point as the final delay. The prediction is 
therefore relative to the delay at the starting point.

The "relative position" model is also used in the DB Navigator App (with some additional logic).

# 4. Approaches to Challenges of the Problem

## 4.1. Approach for the Imbalanced Data

There are 3 different ways to deal with class imbalance: Data-level approach, algorithm-level approach and a hybrid form. 
In the data-level approach, an attempt is made to balance the data set before a classification algorithm is used. 
In the algorithm-level approach, the imbalance of classes is taken into account in the structure of the algorithm, 
for example in the loss function. The last approach is a hybrid form of both.

In this project, we use *Smote*.

**Smote:** In the following, we will describe one of the best known forms of oversampling called 
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique). The idea of the method originates from handwriting recognition,
where one creates new training data by rotating, flipping, and distorting, which has been successful in 
improving performance. We will now describe the method from the paper by Chawla et al. SMOTE generates new training 
data in a general way, it is not specific to only one application. New synthetic observations are created by performing 
operations not in the "data space" but in the "feature space".


The minority classes are all oversampled in the SMOTE algorithm. Let us explain the procedure using one of the 
minority classes: Take an observation from the class and compute the k-nearest neighbors. Depending on how many 
synthetic observations one wants to create, neighbors are 
randomly chosen from the method. Now the difference between the feature vector (the observation) and the nearest 
neighbor is calculated. Now multiply the difference by a random number between 0-1 and add the result to the 
feature vector. This gives a random point on a line between 2 observations. This approach thus tries to generalize 
the decision space of the minority class.

<em>Fig: Example of a binary classification with 2 features.</em>
</figure>

## 4.2. Flexibility of the Problem

First, let's explain in more detail how the ordinal classifier works, and then let's explain the Stacking procedure 
and how it can use flexibility to its advantage.

### 4.2.1 Ordinal Classification

Ordinary classifications cannot use the information of the order for ordered classes. They assume unordered classes 
and classify accordingly. The class distance in case of misclassification is not taken into account and is penalized 
the same for each distance. The problem of ordered classes is also called ordinal classification or regression. But 
how can this information be used?

The problem is first partitioned from a multiclassification with K classes into k - 1 binary classifications. 
We assume that the ordinal attribute is denoted as A* with ordered classes V_1, V_2, ..., V_K. A binary classification 
is defined for the first k-1 classes (i.e., for all but the last class). The i-th binary classification tests for 
each observation with attribute A* whether A* > V_i holds or not. One creates new data sets for the K - 1 binary 
classifications from the original data set. In the next step, one applies a binary classifier to each newly generated 
dataset, outputting the two class probabilities (rather than the class). Now, to make predictions for our original 
classification, one uses the predictions of the K - 1 binary classifiers:

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/ordinal.png" alt="flexibility-img">
</figure>

To calculate the probability of the first and last class, we need only one classifier each, the first and last. The class with the highest probability is predicted.
Empirical results can be found in the paper by Eibe Frank and Mark Hal.

**Example**: *Define 3 classes. We now convert the multiclassification with 3 classes into 2 binary classifiers.
After training the 2 binary classifiers, we can compute the probabilities of the original 3 ordered classes:*
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/ordinal_2.png" alt="flexibility-img">
</figure>

In our case, we would have 6 binary classification tasks.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/binary_ex.png" alt="flexibility-img">
</figure>


### 4.2.2. Stacking

As we have already seen, there are very many machine learning algorithms, with different problem approaches that can be 
followed. The problem now is to test each of these algorithms individually and then select the best one based on a 
metric. Stacking now replaces this process by no longer having to "hand pick" an algorithm, but Stacking leaves this 
work to another Machine Learning algorithm. In fact, the algorithm no longer has to select a single model, but can 
actually combine several to make the best prediction.

Stacking is an ensemble technique that combines information from many different models to develop a new model. 
Simply put, Stacking obtains the output of each model from different machine learning algorithms that train different 
models. The collected outputs are then formed into a new data set. In the second step, this new dataset is then 
considered as a new supervised problem and a new machine learning algorithm finally solves the problem. The models in 
the first step are also called level-0 or base learners. The model in the second step that combines all predictions 
into one is called a meta learner or level-1 generalizer. The output of the base learner is then also called meta 
features, the new features for the meta learner.

<em>Fig: Simple sketch about stacking.</em>
</figure>


# 5. Data preparation and Analysis

An important component for a machine learning approach is a good data basis. It is essential to understand 
the data precisely and to cleanse it of erroneous or missing values. In the first part, we will explain how the data 
is collected and how the data is structured. In the second part, we will show examples of erroneous data and how 
we deal with them. In the last section, we analyze our cleaned data.

## 5.1. Data Basis


**Train Running Messages:** The largest part of our data consists of train running messages. These messages are generated by sensors located at the
beginning and end of each train station. A train is now detected if it passes through a station, stops there or 
departs. For passages, the measured values of these sensors are interpolated so that only one time for the passage is 
indicated. Various key figures are created, whereby we will only use key figures that are important for a delay 
prediction in a certain way. 


**Train-specific key figures:** Another data source gives us the train length (zl laenge), maximum train speed (zl vmax) and train type.
The train type plays a particularly important role in the forecast, since a long-distance train behaves differently 
than a freight train, for example.


**Incidents:** If the travel time between two measuring points (sensors) is at least 90 seconds longer than the target travel time, a 
so-called lost unit is created. These must then be recorded with a reason for delay. The reasons originate 
from 55 cause groups (vuid), which in turn are divided into 9 super-groups.

Here, we will separate two different types of incidents. On the one hand, we have train-specific incidents, 
such as a drive malfunction on the vehicle, and on the other hand incidents specific to the operating site, such 
as a construction site. Train-specific incidents may extend throughout the entire train journey, which is why, if an 
incident occurs on the train, we record it at each additional measuring point for the train in question.

**Holidays:** Another data source gives us the school vacations and public holidays for each state.

**Weather Data:** The following key figures are taken into account: Temperature in Celsius, snow height, rain, new snow per hour, 
wind gusts, mean wind within one hour.


# 6. Analysis of Solution

In this part we will describe and evaluate our approaches. 

## 6.1. Setup

We will first restrict the analysis to the corridor Fulda - Frankfurt - Mannheim, to the period from 01.07.2018 to 
01.08.2019 and to long-distance trains only. We restrict ourselves to estimate the delay in Mannheim and include 2 
stops before entering the corridor, i.e. 2 stops before Fulda.

To compare different approaches, we need to standardize the evaluation process for all approaches. We evaluate our 
results on the UE P, UEI, FFU (Fulda), and RM (Mannheim) starting points at arrival and departure, respectively, using the k-fold 
cross-validation method.

**Splitting the Data:** We have to keep one thing in mind when splitting the data: Days that are in the test set should 
not be in the training set. If we did not pay attention to this, we would not use true "unseen" days, because the model 
may be able to draw information from these days during training, but we would not have it in practice. Note that it can 
also be information that is "in the future" (relative to the observation).


## 6.2. Features

We will roughly present the most important features here, although there are of course slight deviations in the various 
approaches.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/features.png" alt="flexibility-img" width="500">
</figure>


## 6.3. Approaches

### 6.3.1. Approach 1: Variable Route

In this first approach, we fix the end point as the operating point where we also want to predict the delay. In this 
case, it would therefore be Mannheim. However, in order to collect as many observations as possible, the starting 
points can be freely chosen as long as they are within the corridor. In this approach, we only train one model.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/solution_1.png" alt="flexibility-img">
<em>Fig: FFU (Fulda), FF (Frankfurt) and RM (Mannheim). Approach 1: Variable Route.</em>
</figure>

**Evaluation and Assessment:** One of the greatest strengths of the model is that we have a large amount of data. In 
 total, we have the largest data base of all approaches.

The best model that we trained was a multiclassification approach with Random Forest classifier. However, compared to 
the relative situation, our model has little improvement. The problem is that different route segments behave 
differently and we cannot represent this distinction well enough by our chosen features. As a result, even our model 
will be able to mix the characteristics of individual route sections and not generalize them. In the next approach, 
we will therefore try to incorporate localization more strongly.   



### 6.3.2. Approach 2: Fixed Route

In this approach we will jump to the other extreme: We fix the route and thus get no more flexibility in the start 
and end point. For each route, we train a separate model.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/solution_2.png" alt="flexibility-img">
<em>Fig: Approach 2: Fixed Route.</em>
</figure>

**Evaluation and Assessment:** Fixation allows the model to capture certain characteristics of the route, thus solving the disadvantage of the first 
approach, non-localization. Despite the fixation, in some cases we still have a considerable amount of data, for example 
the Frankfurt-Mannheim route. Namely, we capture all long-distance trains that travel over this fixed route. In fact, 
we achieve a significant increase on this route compared to the first model.

But we also have to train models for routes that are not heavily trafficked. This is because we have to train a model 
for every possible operating point that comes into question as a starting point in order to make delay forecasts for 
this operating point as well. This is where difficulties arise: Some routes are so infrequently traveled that we cannot 
get a proper model trained. We do get results with the approach on heavily traveled routes, but overall there are too 
many routes that we cannot model. The approach is not usable. However, realizing that in cases where we train a model 
on a highly localized route, but also have a lot of training data, we get better, we can consider it in our next model.

### 6.3.3. Approach 3: Output-Input

Another idea to represent the localities is to train a model for each section. We will feed the output of one section 
model into the next.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/solution_3.png" alt="flexibility-img">
<em>Fig: Approach 3: Output-Input.</em>
</figure>

**Evaluation and Assessment:** For the best result, we have used a regression problem with XGBoost regressor for every 
track section except the last one and a multiclassification with an XGBoost classifier for the last section.

We actually get better with the approach than the variable route approach. The results suggest that we were able to 
incorporate the dynamics of the track sections through our model. However, passing the output of one model into the 
next leads to error propagation. The error of one model is passed on to the next model. The next approach skips this 
step.


### 6.3.4. Approach 4: Segment by Segment

Here, as in the previous approach, we consider the route in sections. However, here we will make predictions directly 
for the endpoint and not for individual segments. Since the route segments and stops are now "constant" for each 
observation, we can also create specific features for route segments and stops for each observation. With this approach
we create models for each segment.


<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/train-delay-prediction/solution_4.png" alt="flexibility-img">
<em>Fig: Approach 4: Segment by Segment.</em>
</figure>


**Evaluation and Assessment:** The best results are obtained by a multiclassification problem with XGBoost classifier. 
After a long search for the best approach, we found one that solves both problems: We get a lot of data from the 
approach and can capture the dynamics that exist on this route by classifying it in section-wise models. 
Compared to the relative position, our model is better in each selected metric.

In the next step we will further improve the results with stacking.

**Stacking:** The question of which base learner and meta learner to use is not an easy one. There are also no clear 
models in the literature that work better than others. It is small experimental steps that one has to take to find out 
what works for our problem and what does not. After much searching, we built a stacking model that trains 19 base 
learners with an XGBoost classifier as the meta learner.

# 7. Conclusion and Outlook

By analyzing different solution approaches, we have recognized that the "section-by-section" solution approach 
delivers the best results. The performance can be increased with the ensemble method Stacking. The machine learning 
algorithms Random Forest, XGBoost, OneVsRest, Neural Networks, OrdinalClassifier and Logistic Regression were used 
and written in Python. For traditional Machine Learning algorithms we used the library sklearn and for Deep Learning 
algorithms keras, based on Tensorflow.

We narrowed our analysis in 3 ways: Time period, train type and track. By extending the time period (data available 
up to 2014), we can obtain more training data and thus increase the performance of the model if necessary, since 
machine learning algorithms generally perform better when they have more data. We obviously want to be able to use 
delay prediction on other rail lines. It would be interesting when analyzing on other corridors to see if the approach 
performs well on other routes as well, or if in some way we have overfitted the approach to the selected route. The 
same reasoning applies to an analysis for different train types.
