# Abstract
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks are data-hungry and when the situation arises, where data is scarce, NLP 
models often fail to carry out reliable generalizations. Humans can, however, generalize only by seeing a few 
labeled examples on a specific task. Motivated by this, the rise in popularity in techniques that can generalize to 
new tasks containing only a few samples, called Few-Shot Learning, was inevitable. This survey discusses pre-trained 
Language Models and Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Training and Transfer in NLP, critically assess their application and 
identifies future work. Furthermore, we study the application of Few-Shot approaches in a cross-lingual setting.     


# 1. Introduction

Deep learning methods defined NLP in recent
years, achieving impressive performance when sufficient amounts of labeled data are available. However, from a 
practical view, in many tasks, a large
scale dataset is not available, e.g. low-resource languages, and annotating new labeled data labels is
expensive and time-consuming (Fort, 2016), leaving us with only building more efficient algorithms
as conventional deep learning methods fail in this
low data regime (Yogatama et al., 2019). Humans,
on the other hand, only need a few demonstrations
to learn new language tasks. Motivated by this,
Few-Shot Learning tries to solve all those issues by
learning just from a few labeled samples.

# 1.1. Few-Shot Scenario

Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is the ability to learn tasks with limited examples. Most existing FSL problems are  
supervised learning problems, which is our focus in this survey. In an ($N$-way-)$K$-shot classification problem, 
we are only given $K$ labeled examples per class, where the number of classes is $N$. $K$-shot regression estimates 
a regression function given only $K$ input-output example pairs.

To understand the challenges and approaches to Few-Shot Learning, we first analyze existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) 
supervised approaches for NLP tasks.   


## 1.2. Introducing Prior Knowledge

In a normal supervised setting, we would train our model on hundreds of thousands to millions of input–output 
pairs, which found success in numerous fields. However, studies show that in NLP tasks, this paradigm of supervised 
learning does not generalize well outside the training data characteristics (Jia and Liang, 2017; Belinkov and 
Bisk, 2018),  even when provided with enormous training data. The models are sensitive to noise, adversarial 
examples and are prone to overfitting. The reason is that language is complex and diverse and when conditions 
change, e.g. a new domain, the model is not able to adapt. Without any modification to the supervised approach, our 
Few-Shot Learning scenario will even amplify the poor generalization. 

The most prominent way to help generalization is to induce an inductive bias by using transfer learning (Ruder, 
2019), especially using pre-trained representations.

</figure>

In the last years, NLP saw the rise of pre-trained language 
representations for downstream tasks, achieving new SOTA on many NLP tasks. First, single-layer representations 
using word embedding vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013a) followed by contextualized word embeddings (Dai and Le, 2015; 
McCann et al., 2018a; Peters et al., 2018) were proposed, which were both simply fed into a task-specific 
architecture. With the rise of transformer language models (Vaswani et al., 2017), which enable direct finetuning of 
the whole architecture, there was no need for task-specific architectures anymore (Devlin et al., 2019). This was a 
breakthrough for NLP as many SOTA on NLP tasks were achieved by finetuning on task-specific samples using 
transformers, that are simply pre-trained on a language modeling objective  in a semi-supervised fashion, inducing 
contextualized word embeddings. Clark et al. (2019) show
that a pre-trained transformer model, like BERT,
obtain knowledge about characteristics of the language, e.g. syntax and semantics as well as certain
facts about the world, in short, have some general-purpose language understanding capacity, which
can explain the generalization ability on a finetuned
task.

## 1.3. Few-Shot Learning Challenges

One could naively apply the same strategy as in
a normal supervised setting for our Few-Shot scenario: Finetune a pre-trained transformer model
on the few labeled examples. Even though the pre-training helps the model to generalize on a new
task, a sufficient amount of labeled data (Yogatama
et al., 2019) is still needed in order to get reasonable
results. The Figure 1 shows that in Few-Shot scenarios (i.e. < 1000 examples), all models lack far
behind the fully trained variants, indicating sample inefficiency of the transformer model BERT.
Additionally, the BERTscratch does not learn much
without inducing an inductive bias via pre-training,
showing the importance of the procedure. The Figure 1 also shows that, pre-training (sequentially)
on similar tasks can help in a Few-Shot scenario,
however, the sample inefficiency remains. 

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/few-shot/figure_1.png" alt="interview-img" width="400">
</figure>

Similar to this, Multi-Task Learning leverages information
contained in multiple related tasks to help improve
the generalization performance on all tasks (Zhang
and Yang, 2021). Nonetheless, the method favors
tasks with significantly more data, making it unsuitable for Few-Shot tasks. Another problem of big
transformers is that they suffer from high variance (Phang et al., 2019; Dodge et al., 2020). This is amplified in 
a Few-Shot scenario, where Language Models only finetune on a few samples (Zhang et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2020). 
Changing the set of training examples can result in significant performance differences. Therefore, it is 
essential to use the same set or average between multiple equal sets when comparing Few-Shot approaches, making it 
hard to compare different approaches. (Zhang et al., 2021) provide alternative practices to reduce instability.

<em>High Variance: Distribution of task scores across 20 random restarts for BERT,
and BERT with intermediary fine-tuning on MNLI. Fine-tuned on no more than
1k examples for each task. [Phang, 2019]</em>
</figure>


The question remains, how a transformer model can effectively leverage the few given examples without 
suffering from high variance. Section 2 describes a method that tries to exploit the induced bias of 
pre-trained language models explicitly through using the model directly by reformulating the task as a 
language model problem. Driven by the results of pre-training sequentially on similar tasks, see Figure 1, 
Section 3 will analyze Meta-Learning Approaches, which also "pre-train" on similar tasks to induce an 
inductive bias with the goal to use the model in a Few-Shot scenario. Section 4 will cover the use-case of 
K-Shot CrossLingual Transfer. Finally, Section 5 will conclude this survey.    

# 2. Reformulating Tasks as Language Modelling Problems

As pre-trained language models possess some general language purpose understanding, the idea is to solve Few-Shot 
Learning tasks through directly using the obtained linguistic knowledge by reformulating tasks as language 
modeling problems and then predicting labels as "fill-in-the-blank" tasks, sharing the same format as pre-training 
LMs.     

<figure>

## 2.1 Approaches

Brown et al. (2020) introduces GPT-3, which essentially uses the same model as GTP-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
, but scales the data, training time, and model to billion parameters. On the contrary to standard 
finetuning that condition on the task on the algorithmic level p(output|input), the idea of GPT series is to 
condition the model on the selected task p(output|input, task), by inducing the task into the text 
sequence with a task description. A reading comprehension training example could be formulated as (**answer 
the question, document question, answer**).      

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/few-shot/boolq.png" alt="interview-img" width="600">
</figure>

To create a training set, they scraped web pages,
but with a focus on document quality. The hope is
that task formulations occur naturally in the dataset.
Brown et al. (2020) explore different settings for
learning within context, which means that during
inference, the model is given a prompt, which consists of a task description and K examples of context  and 
completion, which they call model priming. Then to make predictions, one final context is
given, but the model has to fill in the completion.
One important note is, that the model does not do
any weight updates during inference, even after
seeing the K examples, leaving room for more optimization. Additionally, K is upper bounded by
the context windows size ($n_{ctx} = 2048$), meaning
that typically the window fits around 10 to examples.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/few-shot/gpt_3.png" alt="interview-img" width="600">
</figure>

With this strategy of using the pre-trained
language model directly, GTP-3 shows impressive
Few-Shot capabilities across diverse tasks, surpassing some strong finetuned models baselines, such
as tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmarks (Wang
et al., 2020) by only giving 32 labeled examples.
However, for finding the right prompt, a hold out
set is necessary, which then in return needs more
examples. As we are in a Few-Shot scenario, this
makes it difficult to obtain a sufficiently large hold
out set. As GTP-3 naively concatenates the K
randomly selected examples (as the model’s input
size is bounded) with the input to create their in-
context learning, the model does not make sure
that the most informative demonstration are prioritized. However, prioritizing is important, since
the number of usable demonstrations is bounded
by the model’s input size. We will call this problem in-context selection problem. Furthermore,
as GPT-3 uses an autoregressive language model,
experiments do not include any bidirectional architectures, even though Raffel et al. (2020) indicate
that (finetuned) models benefit from such bidirectionality to solve NLP tasks. Finally, as GPT-3
has billion parameters, performing inference
is expensive and makes it impracticable for many
applications.   

Schick and Schütze (2021b) introduce **iPET**, a
task-agnostic method for Few-Shot Learning that
can perform on par with the GTP-3 model on the
SuperGLUE dataset using a times smaller Language Model, making the approach more "greener"
and practical. Instead of providing prompts, as
in the GPT models, iPET uses pattern-exploiting
training (PET) (Schick and Schütze, 2021a), which reformulates tasks as cloze questions (no additional context 
samples provided) with regular gradient-based finetuning. Addititionally, the model utilizes gradient steps after 
seeing the K examples. For that, PET requires a pattern-verbalizer pairs (PVPs) $p = (P,v)$, which maps the input x of 
a task to a cloze question formulation. They call this a pattern P. Then for each possible output $y$ of the task, 
PET maps it to a single token, representing its task-specific meaning in the pattern, called verbalizer $v$. 
Now, given a pre-trained masked language model, we only have to check the probabilities of the mapped output $v(y)$ being 
the correct token at the masked position. 

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/few-shot/pet.png" alt="interview-img" width="600">
</figure>

To generate good PVPs on a small development set of held out tasks, PET 
uses a combination of 3 PVPs per pattern for which a separate pre-trained MLM is first finetuned on the given (small)
training set and then used to annotate unlabeled examples. Finally, the soft-labeled dataset is used to finetune a 
single sequence classifier, which is closely related to knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015). However, 
PET only works when the answer is a single token. Schick and Schütze (2021b) proposes iPET, which modifies PET to 
handle more than just one token during predictions and refines the generation of PVPs by enabling them to learn from 
each other. Schick and Schütze (2021b) shows that iPET with ALBERT (Lan et al., 2020) as the underlying LM achieves 
similar results on the SuperGLUE dataset as GTP3, given 32 examples. Additionally, iPET with ALBERT only uses 
million parameters, which is a magnitude smaller than GTP-3. Even though iPET mitigates the problems of choosing a 
single cloze question formulation (pattern) by combining multiple formulations, it still requires engineering a set 
of suitable patterns. Furthermore, iPET requires additional unlabeled data, which it uses in the knowledge 
distillation stage. This can be hard to acquire, where samples are pairs of text with a label, constructed to test a 
model’s natural language understanding abilities (e.g. SuperGLUE). (Tam et al., 2021) propose **ADAPET**, which uses 
no unlabeled data by providing more supervision by modifying PET’s objective. ADAPET outperforms iPET on SuperGLUE 
without any unlabeled data.          

<figure>

selected examples and for iPET after training on 32 random examples.</em>
</figure>

GTP and PET models use prompt-based (pattern-based) prediction, but finding the right prompt/pattern is an art. Gao 
et al. (2020) proposes **LM-BFF**, which alleviates this problem by generating the prompt automatically given a few
examples, outperforming or matching manually selected prompts. Gao et al. (2020) first finds a label
word mapping given a template (pattern) and then
generates a diverse set of templates from the fixed
set of label words by using the T5 model (Raf-
fel et al., 2020). Even though Gao et al. (2020)
propose a way to automatically find prompts, it
still needs an "initial" template (pattern) or label
words, inducing a bias that could potentially restrict the search space to a suboptimal one. Contrary to iPET, 
LM-BFF uses demonstrations for
each input by concatenating them for additional
context. However, to combat the *in-context selection problem* (see GTP-3), LM-BFF randomly
selects a single example from each class for each
input iterative at a time to create multiple, minimal demonstration sets, making it more efficient
for Few-Shot tasks than GTP-3. As the underlying
Language model, they use RoBERTa large model,
which is again a magnitude smaller than GTP-3,
with $K = 16$ examples and then use prompt-based
finetuning with demonstrations. Notice that the
finetuning process is different than iPET, which
does not use any demonstrations, and GPT-3’s in-
context learning, which simply concatenates the
input with demonstrations randomly drawn from
the training set with no finetuning. Gao et al. (2020)
evaluates on 8 tasks from the GLUE benchmark
(Wang et al., 2019), SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015),
and sentence classification tasks. Gao et al. (2020)
show that their method of prompt-based finetuning outperforms standard finetuning (on $K = 16$
examples), except for the CoLA task and outperforms the GPT-3-style in-context learning. They
also show that using demonstrations in context performs better than without any demonstrations in
the context.

## 2.2. Discussion: Reformulating Tasks for NLP Few-Shot Tasks

Even though the models presented here, achieve
impressive results with only a small amount of examples, it is still lacking quite far behind SOTA
models that finetune on big datasets with thousands
of examples. These approaches also favor tasks,
that can naturally be reformulated as "fill-in-the-
blank” problems, such as sentiment classification
(e.g. positive class: "A fun ride. All in all great."),
leaving room for future work. Additionally, methods require manual work to find a good reformulation for tasks. This 
problem is amplified in practical situations, where we want to deploy such systems since we need domain and 
model expertise to find an optimal reformulation by hand for unseen tasks. Even though Gao et al. (2020) try to 
mitigate this problem by automatically find reformulations, LM-BFF still needs an initial reformulation.  
Additionally, Language Models have a restricted input size. Tasks that have too long input sequences can not be properly 
solved. Future work could investigate using Language Models that allow such long input sequences, e.g. Longformer 
(Beltagy et al., 2020). Furthermore, these approaches finetune the downstream tasks in isolation, not utilizing any 
information from similar tasks.     

# 3. Meta-Learning Algorithms

Additionally to the general-purpose language understanding properties of pre-trained language models, Meta-Learning 
algorithms try to induce another inductive bias, which allows the model to quickly adapt after only seeing a few 
examples. In comparison to the methods described in Section 1.2, Meta-Learning explicitly take the 
Few-Shot scenario into account and utilize information from similar tasks. This is achieved by collecting many 
training tasks, where each training task consists of a training dataset $D_i^{tr} = \{(x_{tr}, y_{tr})\}$,
called support set $S$, and a test set $D_i^{val} = \{(x_{val}, y_{val})\}$. The idea 
is to then pre-train on them such that the final model can generalize to new tasks rapidly, which allows us to 
perform Few-Shot tasks.        

We will discuss 2 popular forms of Meta-learning for NLP tasks (Yin et al., 2020a): Metric-based and 
Optimisation-based learning. 

## 3.1. Metric-based Meta-Learning

The idea in metric-based Meta-Learning is to learn a representation space through the training tasks, which 
enables us to classify test instances correctly by just comparing them to the $K$ labeled examples in this 
representation space.  

Vinyals et al. (2017) proposes Matching Networks, which use two different embedding functions, one for the training 
examples and one for the test examples. The representation of one example can change, depending on the given support 
set $D^{tr}_i$ for the task $T_i$. For a test example $\hat{x}$, given its support set $S$, we choose the class with 
the highest aggregated similarity between class examples in the support set and the test instance by calculating the 
cosine similarity in the embedding space. Vinyals et al. (2017) evaluated Matching Networks on Few-Shot language 
modeling. Even though the approach found many applications in image classification, it has not yet found any 
impressive results in NLP tasks. One of the reasons is that matching networks do not finetune on the support set 
during inference, making it hard to find a good general embedding space that would work for many NLP tasks since 
text is quite diverse. If Matching Networks choose to finetune, it suffers from overfitting issues Vinyals et al. 
(2017), not gaining much in performance.     

To enable finetuning during inference and not
suffer from overfitting, Snell et al. (2017) propose Prototypical Networks, which induce a sim-
ple bias: There exists an embedding space where
points that belong to one class, cluster around a
single prototype representation. For that, they learn
a non-linear mapping of the input into an embedding space using a neural network and calculate
the class’ prototype as the mean of its support set
in the embedding space. Finally, we can classify
a new instance by finding the nearest class prototype. In comparison to Matching Networks, they
do not compare instances to each other but use the
prototypes (class representation) calculated from
the support set. Therefore, only in a Few-Shot scenario, the approaches differ. Additionally, Prototypical Networks 
use  Euclidean distance which outperforms the proposed cosine similarity of Matching
Networks (Snell et al., 2017). Prototypical networks were first originally suggested for images
in computer vision problems, however, the method
was also applied to NLP tasks. Most applications
use pre-trained word embeddings and instead of
averaging to calculate the prototype class, they
use more sophisticated methods, such as attention based prototypes, reaching new SOTA on some
benchmarks (Han et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2019; Hui
et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020) and also finding applications in domain transfer (Bansal et al., 2019).
However, as the metric plays an important role in
gaining performance (Snell et al., 2017), Sung et al.
(2018) introduces a learnable metric instead of a
fixed metric, calling it Relation Networks. Yu
et al. (2018) try to solve diverse Few-Shot text classification by extending Prototype Networks with
clustering similar training tasks, learning one metric for each, and then automatically determining
the best weighted combination of those metrics for a newly seen Few-Shot task.


Matching, Prototypical and Relation Networks in NLP are mostly restricted to test tasks that are very 
similar to the training tasks, e.g. doing domain transfer. When we have diverse NLP tasks, finding an 
appropriate metric space becomes much harder. Yu et al. (2018) try to solve diverse Few-Shot text 
classification by extending Prototype Networks with clustering similar training tasks, learning one metric 
for each, and then automatically determining the best weighted combination of those metrics for a newly 
seen Few-Shot task. They show significant gains on Few-Shot sentiment classification and dialog intent 
classification tasks, indicating that clustering related tasks to handle diverse Few-Shot NLP tasks, might 
be a good research direction to improve metric-based or even optimizationbased Meta-learning approaches 
for Few-Shot NLP tasks. A closely related method to metric-based approaches is supervised contrastive 
learning (Gunel et al., 2021) as both rely on capturing the similarity between examples in one class and 
contrasting them with examples in other classes. Instead of the usual Cross-Entropy Loss of Language Models, which 
is prone to high variance, Gunel et al. (2021) propose a loss function, consisting of cross-entropy and their 
supervised contrastive learning (SCL) term that pushes examples from the same class closer   
and the examples from different classes further apart. Gunel et al. (2021) obtain significant improvements 
over a strong RoBERTa-Large baseline on multiple datasets of the GLUE benchmark in few-shot learning 
settings. This method is closely related to metric-based approaches as both rely on capturing the similarity 
between examples in one class and contrasting them with examples in other classes.            

## 3.2. Optimization-based Meta-Learning

n contrast to metric-based Meta-Learning, optimization-based Meta-Learning approaches try to learn a *good 
set of parameter initialization*, such that the model can quickly converge to a minimum in just a few 
gradient descent steps.    


Finn et al. (2017) proposed the first optimization-based model, called **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)**. 
Let $\theta$ denote the parameter initialization of the model, $\phi_i$ the finetuned model parameters and $L_i$ 
the loss function of each task $\mathcal{T}_i$. The idea is to first sample a (or batch of) task $T_i$ with the 
corresponding (disjoint) datasets $D_i^{tr}, D_i^{val}$. To train the model on 
$D^{tr}_i$, gradient-finetune with respect to the loss function $L_i$ to obtain $\phi_i$. We 
then can update the original initial model parameters $\theta$ using the "test" loss $L_i( \phi_i,
D_i^{val})$ across sampled tasks       

$$
    \theta \leftarrow \theta \beta  \nabla_\theta \sum_i \mathcal{L}_i( \phi_i, D_i^{val}).
$$

This enables MAML to find a good parameter initialization that can quickly converge to a minimum, making it suitable 
for Few-Shot Learning.   

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/few-shot/meta_learning.png" alt="interview-img" width="400">
</figure>

This enables MAML to find a good parameter initialization that can quickly converge to a minimum,
making it suitable for Few-Shot Learning. The
model was used for Few-Shot text classification
(Han et al., 2018; Obamuyide and Vlachos, 2019;
Jiang et al., 2018; Bao et al., 2020), where each
class is considered a task. Additionally, Jiang
et al. (2018) introduces task-agnostic parameters
and task-specific parameters to MAML, which they
call ATAML, outperforming vanilla MAML on
Few-Shot topic classification. MAML has also
seen applications in Few-Shot domain adaption,
e.g. Few-Shot dialogue system (Lin et al., 2019;
Mi et al., 2019; Qian and Yu, 2019), where each do-
main dialog is treated as a task. One problem that
MAML has, is that it is both computationally and
memory intensive since it needs to calculate second
derivatives in equation (1) as we get a nested back-
propagation, where second derivates may come
up. **First-Order MAML (FOMAML)** and **REPTILE** (Finn et al., 2017; Nichol et al., 2018) are
methods which approximate the second derivative.
One of the biggest challenges is to apply MAML
to diverse tasks, as most applications are limited
to similar train and test tasks, e.g. domain adap-
tion tasks or to simulated classification datasets
where each label is considered a task. Furthermore,
even though the approach itself is model agnostic,
meaning we can combine any model representation
and any differentiable objective, the approach is
restricted to tasks that have the same label space
since to learn a good initialization, MAML requires
sharing model parameters, including softmax classification layers across tasks.

To enable MAML to learn across diverse tasks
with disjoint label spaces, Bansal et al. (2019) proposes **LEOPARD**, which uses a parameter generator,  which learns 
on $D_{tr}$ to generate task-dependent $i$
initial softmax classification parameters for any
specific task. Furthermore, the approach transforms
the text input into a feature representation by using a (shared) BERT model across tasks. To find
a good parameter initialization, LEOPARD uses a modified MAML-based adaptation method by distinction between task-specific parameters, which 
are adapted per task, and task-agnostic parameters, 
which are shared across tasks. This is similar to 
Jiang et al. (2018). This allows for more efficient 
adaptation. Since BERT has a high number of parameters, LEOPARD uses lower-layers of BERT as 
task-agnostic parameters and higher-level layer and 
the softmax generating function as task-specific parameters. Since we already used $D_{tr}$ to generate i
task-depended initial softmax classification parameters, we use subsequent batches for adaption. 

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/few-shot/leopard.png" alt="interview-img">
</figure>

On the 
contrary to vanilla MAML, LEOPARD can handle test tasks that are notably different from the training tasks. 
They evaluate LEOPARD using target tasks that were not seen during training and evaluate on their entire 
test set after finetuning on K examples per label from the corresponding training set. The target tasks 
were selected such that they differ significantly from the training task and have a varying number of labels.
They show that on average LEOPARD performs significantly better than the chosen baselines, BERT-base model 
(Devlin et al., 2019), Multi-task BERT (comparable to Liu et al. (2019)) and a Prototypical Network (Snell 
et al., 2017) that uses BERT-base as the underlying neural model. With that experiment, they show that 
LEOPARD can leverage Meta-learning to learn a more general-purpose parameter initialization that can then be 
used to solve completely unseen new tasks with just a few examples. Furthermore, Bansal et al. (2019) 
evaluate Few-Shot Domain-transfer, showing that LEOPARD performs on par or better than the baselines. They 
also show that prototypical networks give competitive results on domain-transfer tasks. One disadvantage of 
LEOPARD is that it requires labeled data from many different tasks, for training and also hyperparameter tuning. 
Additionally, it suffers from overfitting to the training task-distribution (Bansal et al., 2019, 2020) 
(Meta-overfitting), leaving room for a more efficient adaption to diverse tasks.      


## 3.3 Discussion: Meta-Learning for NLP Few-Shot Tasks

One of the main challenges in Meta-Learning (in  general) is to create training tasks that enable Meta-learning 
algorithms to find a good initialization set  to solve the target task (Vinyals et al., 2017). As  previously 
mentioned, many applications create  training tasks from a fixed task dataset, where we have many labels, by 
subsampling from the set of
labels. While it enables to generalize to unseen
labels, this can also lead to overfitting to the training task distribution, making it hard to generalize
to unseen tasks (Yin et al., 2020a). Furthermore,
one of the reasons why most Meta-learning algorithms were first proposed in image classification
problems is because they have big labeled sets with
a large number of labels. In NLP tasks, however,
they are often restricted to a small number of labels, e.g. sentiment classification has only a few
discrete labels. To remedy this, Bansal et al. (2020)
propose a self-supervised approach to generate a
Meta-learning task distribution from an unlabeled
text by masking words from a specified vocabulary (or subsets of it) and posing it as a multi-class
classification. Combining the generated tasks with
the available supervised tasks can improve Meta-learning algorithms, such as LEOPARD (Bansal
et al., 2020). However, as these generated tasks
are only (masked language) classification tasks,
this can lead to a narrow training-task distribution.
Additionally, most of the research only explores
classification problems, leaving room for future
work to expand into more diverse problem structures and to find more suitable ways to generate
diverse Meta-learning tasks.   

One major obstacle for Meta-learning ap-
proaches is to solve diverse NLP Few-Shot tasks.
Meta-Learning approaches may work well for sim-
ulated datasets, where we just subsample labels
from one single task dataset and define them as
training tasks because the underlying task does not
change in this situation, e.g. the model was “pre-
trained” to solve translation tasks. However, if you
want to test on a truly unseen task, the model has
to first learn the underlying task from a few given
examples. Jiang et al. (2018); Bansal et al. (2019)
mitigate this problem by introducing task-specific
parameters and task-agnostic parameters for more
efficient adaption. Another interesting approach
for future work could be to combine Meta learning
with additional task information, e.g. task descrip-
tions, to solve new diverse tasks (approaches in
Section 2 do this).

# 4. $K$-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer with Multilingual Language Models

This section will deal with K-Shot Cross-Lingual
Transfer as a use-case of Few-Shot Learning.
Achieving SOTA on (monolingual) NLP tasks is usually done by using transformers, pre-trained on language 
modeling objectives in a semi-supervised fashion, and then finetuning on a specific NLP task, which in 
return need a lot of labeled training data. Those are available in common languages, such as the English 
language, however, in low resource languages models fail to generalize well. The idea is to transfer the 
knowledge about a task from a high resource language to another low resource language, called cross-lingual 
transfer (CLT).      

To achieve CLT between tasks from different languages, one has to induce a shared representation space 
between the source and target language. Previous SOTA methods used to induce continuous cross-lingual 
representation spaces by using cross-lingual word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Glavaš et al., 2019) 
and sentence embeddings (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019). However, with transformers getting popular, this 
survey will focus on inducing multilingual word embeddings with transformers.    

## 4.1. Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer

One way to try to combat sparsely labeled training data in one language is by pretraining transformer models on 
multiple languages and automatically induce a multilingual word embedding. This idea gave rise to powerful 
massively multilingual transformers, such as mBert, XLM-R, and the recently introduced mT5 (Devlin et al., 2019; 
Conneau et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2021). These architectures can encode text from any of the languages seen in 
pretraining and allows for a very straightforward approach to Zero-Shot cross-lingual model transfer: Finetune the 
model using task-specific supervised training data from one high resource language (source-training) and predict on 
other languages by feeding the target language text into the finetuned model. Pires et al. (2019) show effective 
results of Zero-Shot cross-lingual transfer with mBERT on POS tagging and NER for related languages. Furthermore, Wu 
et al. (2020); K et al. (2020) show the cross-lingual potential of mBERT by extending the analysis. Nevertheless, 
the literature mostly showed good results in languages that were from the same language family or that had a large 
corpus in pretraining, languages such as German, Spanish or French. This concern is raised by multiple sources 
(Lauscher et al., 2020; Wu and Dredze, 2020), which show that the performance drops huge for distant target languages and target languages that have small pre-training corpus.

<figure>

<em>Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer performance with mBERT.</em>
</figure>

Furthermore, Lauscher et al. (2020) empirically
show that for massively multilingual transformers, pre-training corpora sizes affect the Zero-Shot
performance in higher-level language understanding tasks (e.g. NLI and QA), whereas the results
in lower-level language understanding tasks are
more impacted by typological language proximity. To summarize, Zero-Shot cross-lingual transfer
with source training is effective for languages that
are linguistically similar and languages that have a
great amount of data for pre-training. However, this
scenario is almost always never the case for low
resource languages, where cross-lingual transfer is
needed. The next section will investigate Few-Shot
transfer to mitigate the transfer gap.          

## 4.2. Few-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer

To improve upon the results of Zero-Shot CLT,
which only uses source training, we now additionally exploit the K task-specific examples in
the target language (Few-Shot cross-lingual scenario) by further finetuning on those K examples
(target-adapting). Lauscher et al. (2020) experiment with Few-Shot CLT on lower-level structured
prediction tasks (POS tagging, dependency parsing,
and NER) and higher-level language understanding
tasks (NLI and QA) with varying numbers of K
examples. They show that distant languages gain
much more in performance from Few-Shot data
than closely related languages. Hedderich et al.
(2020) use Few-Shot CLT on NER task on genuine
low-resource languages like Hausa and isiXhosa,
also showing significant improvements by finetuning on the few examples. Zhao et al. (2020) applied
Few-Shot CLT with mBERT on POS, NER, and
sequence classification, observing the same phenomenon. In summary, additional finetuning on
the given few examples from the target language
can significantly improve performances on distant
languages Exactly where Zero-Shot CLT fails.
Since we only have to finetune on a small set of
examples, this additional finetuning is not computationally expensive but shows promising results.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/few-shot/few-shot.png" alt="interview-img">
<em>Results of the few-shot experiments with varying numbers of
target-language examples $k$.</em>
</figure>

As we only discussed "naively" finetuning for
target adaption, one could further investigate how
to exploit the given examples efficiently. Zhao et al.
(2020) investigated freezing parameters during finetuning to mitigate the overfitting problem, however,
experiments show no significant improvements in performance. To use the few given examples more efficiently, 
Nooralahzadeh et al. (2020) use MAML to further find optimal initialization parameters (after source 
training), which then can be used for either Zero-Shot or again finetuning in a Few-Shot setup. However, the 
method requires many training tasks in low-resource languages. Future work could focus on using 
Meta-Learning further.      

One downside of all Few-Shot CLT approaches is that you need labeled data in the low resource target 
language, which is typically hard to acquire. It may become costly to annotate data for minor languages, 
however as Lauscher et al. (2020) show, even 10 annotated instances can give substantial performance 
improvement. This begs the question if annotating data is more cost-efficient in the long run than using GPU 
hours.     

# 5. Conclusion and Discussion

We studied two methods to tackle Few-Shot tasks in NLP: Using pre-trained Language Models and Meta-learning. 
Even though Meta-Learning provides diverse applications as most methods are task and model agnostic, they 
struggle to solve unseen diverse NLP tasks. Future work should investigate how to improve generalization 
to new tasks. Pre-trained language models can be effective by reformulating NLP tasks as language model 
problems, enabling Few-Shot abilities. However these methods require manual work to find a good reformulation and 
they favor tasks, that can be naturally reformulated as a "fill-in-the-blank" task. We 
then discussed a use-case of Few-Shot Learning: Few-Shot CLT. In CLT, we have the chance to first finetune 
in a rich-resource language, and then transfer the knowledge to a low-resource language. Using more 
sophisticated methods to train on high resource languages, e.g. Meta-Learning (Nooralahzadeh et al., 2020), 
can improve performance and is a promising research direction. Nevertheless, most methods need labeled 
examples in low resource languages, making them expensive to obtain. As previously discussed in Section 1.3, 
almost all Few-Shot techniques have high variance. Therefore, we identify the necessity of standardization of   
Few-Shot datasets. As a final word, there are other approaches to Few-Shot Learning in NLP that was 
not discussed in this survey, e.g. unifying NLP tasks formats (McCann et al., 2018b; Yin et al., 2020b; 
Raffel et al., 2020; Khashabi et al., 2020).
