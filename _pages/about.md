Welcome to my personal homepage! My name is **Minh Duc Bui**, but you can call me Duc. I am a PhD student specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at JGU Mainz, under the supervision of **Katharina von der Wense** (nèe Kann). My research centers on **cross-cultural NLP**, exploring how NLP techniques can be adapted to understand and respect cultural differences. I aim to develop models that are sensitive to cultural nuances, ultimately fostering better global communication and inclusivity in AI applications.

Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's degree in "Mathematics in Business and Economics", and subsequently pursued a master's degree in "Data Science" with a strong emphasis on NLP at the University of Mannheim (supervised by Goran Glavaš). Following the completion of my master's degree, I transitioned into the industry, where I worked as a data scientist in the autonomous driving field in Stuttgart for some time.
